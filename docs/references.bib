A transfer function typifies the inertial characteristics of a linear system.Information extraction, i.e. the extraction of relevant information from time series containing much more but not relevant information. The separation of signal and noise (noise reduction, filtering, signal estimation) belongs to this category.Optimal control. A time series of (analytical) results can be used for optimum process control.",
